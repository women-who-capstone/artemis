To this end, the Torah has prophesied about him since as early as the book of Genesis (3:15), and continues to speak of him until its conclusion in Revelation (22:20). In this capacity, the Torah acts like its etymological counterpart \"yarah\"  (an archery term) in that it \"teaches\" its adherents how to properly identify with HaShem by helping them to \"reach the mark.” To be sure, one of the most common Hebrew verbs used to identify sin “chatah” literally means, \"to miss the mark.”","A beer podcast from WBEZ, Chicago's public radio station.

The podcast includes lectures, music, interviews, discussions, and readings of the Holy Books of Thelema and other important texts written by Aleister Crowley. Our mission is to spread awareness of the Law of Thelema, the writings of Aleister Crowley, and Ordo Templi Orientis. Speech in the Silence is also a creative outlet for Thelemites, and we encourage listener feedback and participation. ~ The Law of Thelema is revealed in Liber AL vel Legis, also known as The Book of the Law. This Law can be summarized in three verses from the Book: \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.\" ~ \"Love is the law, love under will.\" ~ \"There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt.\" ~ Practitioners of Thelema are called Thelemites. Thelemites work towards the discovery and accomplishment of their True Will, the innermost nature of the individual. ~ The Law of Thelema grants us ultimate personal freedom, but also demands that we each use that freedom to do our True Will and nothing else. As it is written in The Book of the Law: \"... thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that, and no other shall say nay.\" ~ Respecting the divine and solar nature of every human being means that Thelemites mind their own business and do not interfere in the wills of others -- except in cases of tyranny and oppression. As the Book of the Law says \"Every man and every woman is a star.\" ~ Aleister Crowley expands on this idea in his Extenuation: \"Every Star has its own Nature, which is 'Right' for it. We are not to be missionaries, with ideal standards of dress and morals, and such hard ideas. We are to do what we Will, and leave others to do what they Will. We are infinitely tolerant, save of intolerance.\" ~ Aleister Crowley, also called The Master Therion and The Great Beast 666, is the Prophet of the Law of Thelema. In 1904 e.v., Crowley received the Book of the Law in a revelation while on honeymoon with his wife, Rose, in Cairo, Egypt. The reception of this Book trumpeted the beginning of the New Aeon of the Crowned and Conquering Child, where we can observe the decay of the idea of sin; the growth of innocence, self-confidence, and amorality; the increasing prevalence of bisexuality and androgyny; the childlike confidence in technological and cultural progress; and the acceptance of the individual as the fundamental unit of society. ~ Love is the law, love under will.","Hi-Definition Video from around the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim and Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando.

Well, yeah. Depression is an incredibly common and isolating disease experienced by millions, yet often stigmatized by society. The Hilarious World of Depression is a series of frank, moving, and, yes, funny conversations with top comedians who have dealt with this disease, hosted by veteran humorist and public radio host John Moe. Join guests such as Maria Bamford, Paul F. Tompkins, Andy Richter, and Jen Kirkman to learn how they've dealt with depression and managed to laugh along the way. If you have not met the disease personally, it's almost certain that someone you know has, whether it's a friend, family member, colleague, or neighbor. Depression is a vicious cycle of solitude and stigma that leaves people miserable and sometimes dead. Frankly, we’re not going to put up with that anymore. The Hilarious World of Depression is not medical treatment and should not be seen as a substitute for therapy or medication. But it is a chance to gain some insight, have a few laughs, and realize that people with depression are not alone and that together, we can all feel a bit better. The Hilarious World of Depression is made possible by a grant from HealthPartners’ and its Make It Okay campaign which works to reduce the stigma of mental health. www.makeitok.org","The Bi Any Means podcast is a weekly show that features interviews with bloggers, podcasters, and activists about the intersections of atheism, humanism, politics, current events, and social justice.","ESPN 700's interviews from Utah Utes practices and games.","The Road to Now is a series of interviews and conversations meant to trace the historical roots of today’s events.

Their experiences, along with interviews with experts, sc20140302_130747holars, historians, and those still affected directly by the practice, paint a new portrait of how the west was shaped, by the hard work and toil of these invisible women, hidden away through controversy.\n\nThrough Hansen’s careful work, we see how the practice of polygamy affected every aspect of the LDS church’s formation and is still a shadow hanging over the church, visible in it’s approach to marriage, the role of women, and the temple ceremonies. Instead of the historical footnote polygamy is often treated as, Hansen shows how this practice, started in secret and a direct cause of Joseph Smith’s death, responsible for driving the saints to Utah, and then outward again to Mexico and Canada, the root of power struggles both in the church and out, the cause of suspicion and eventually violence including the Mountain Meadows Massacre, was an instigator to most of the history of American West. For the first time, The Year of Polygamy shows how the west was settled not only to claim land and mineral rights, but in a very real way to control the bodies and sexuality of women in a way that reverberates today.

In his early teens he became heavily involved in the church near his home and in Young Life, a non-denominational youth oriented organization with the intention of becoming involved in the ministry of teaching and preaching. He intended to enrol in Bob Jones University, a world-renowned Bible College in his hometown upon graduating high school, but in the summer of 1996 his life changed. Upon studying the bible from cover to cover and realizing many things were askew, and a lot of what he believed his entire life was not in line with what his research found, he left Christianity and went in search of the truth. After many twist and turns, ups and downs and after looking at the many world religions searching for the tangible proof of the right way of life he encountered a Muslim, and was given a Qur’an. After reading the Qur’an cover to cover he accepted Islam in the winter of 1998.\n\n\n\nYusha (Joshua) Evans Currently works as a full-time lecturer and caller to Islam, as well as teaching workshops that have taken him all across the globe.

That's where \"Ethics-Talk\" fits in.  Housed in the Department of Philosophy and Religion at Central Michigan University (CMU), The Center for Professional and Personal Ethics brings you discussions about ethical issues, both pure and applied. For us at EthicsTalk -- \"ethics\" is broad and encompasses things that affect a human being's flourishing.  To that end, students working with the Center discuss ethics-related topics such as academic integrity, intrinsic motivation, procrastination, and cultivating self-regulation and other powerful habits. Additionally, we discuss study and motivational strategies related to intimidating endeavors such as studying for the bar exam. We are also very interested in how technology can either promote or hinder flourishing and discuss \"media ecology\" issues including the thought of Walter Ong and the concept of \"digital virtue\". In addition to our student produced show, scholars, authors and practitioners (such as Michael Strong, Anya Kamenetz, Lindsay Hyde, Thomas Farrell and Dr. Jeffrey Wigand) discuss ethics related issues with the Center's Director. To learn more about the Center, visit us at http://ethics.cmich.edu and follow us on twitter at: http://www.twitter.com/ethicstalk.\n\n******************************************IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS FEED comes from BLOGTALKRADIO and does not include our complete archives.

Less focused on singular tips or tricks it rather attempts to instill a more comprehensive approach to image making and manipulation that relies on Photoshop as its core. To John, Photoshop is as much a printmaking program as it is a photography program.  The emphasis is to encourage the viewers to explore their creative impulses through Photoshop technique and develop a more personal vision.  These episodes are generally longer than many Photoshop podcasts but the goal is to provide the equivalent of a classroom experience with a more thorough examination of the topics.  To see examples of the images John creates and the workshops he offers in Photoshop at the International Center of Photography, Maine Photographic Workshops, Palm Beach Photographic Centre and Santa Fe Workshops please visit www.johnreuter.com.

His great-uncle and adoptive father, Julius Caesar, the most brilliant and successful general in Rome’s history, had been assassinated aged 56 after being the dictator of Rome for only 5 years. Augustus, on the other hand, thrust into the limelight at age 18, with no military or political experience, ruled Rome either as one-third of a triumvirate or by himself for 58 years and died, probably of natural causes, while still in power. His reign laid the foundations of a regime that lasted, in one form or another, for nearly fifteen hundred years through the ultimate decline of the Western Roman Empire and until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. He was one of the most influential figures in all of Western history - and yet I bet most of you hardly know anything about him.\n\n\n\nWELL - THIS IS HIS STORY.\n\n\n\nIt's a story that contains shipwrecks, human sacrifice, betrayal, hairbreadth escapes, unbridled sex, battles on land and at sea, ambushes, family scandals, and above all the unforgiving pursuit of absolute power.\n\n\n\nJoin veteran podcasters Ray Harris (The World War II Podcast) and Cameron Reilly (The Napoleon Bonaparte Podcast) as they go on a journey to discover the true story about Augustus Caesar.\n\n\n\nWARNING: This podcast contains jokes, rude words and music.","A weekly 30 minute show about board games.

Co-hosts Alex Luboff and Jordan Wicker are both avid cocktail party hosts, often in the company of one another, and have had several people approach them separately to ask about sharing some of their accumulated knowledge on cocktails and entertaining.\n\n\n\nThe Speaking Easy Podcast aims to break down the cocktails, planning, and other details needed to throw a great party, whether it’s 4 people or 40.\n\n\n\nNow that twist: we’re most definitely not professionals. Both podcast hosts hold “real” jobs, and outside of hosting in their homes, are not actual bartenders. Alex and Jordan are enthusiasts, and approach the show from that perspective.

That intensely passionate, dynamic and altruistic individuals have lost their core passions and found themselves adrift in the world of healthcare is unacceptable.\nThe Doctor Paradox focuses on 4 key issues:\n1. The factors that explain why doctors are dissatisfied with the world of healthcare.\nBut more importantly…\n2. The physicians that have rediscovered their passions and carved new paths, both within and outside of traditional healthcare.\n3. The experts who offer insight on topics related to the challenges faced and the mechanisms to address them such as sleep deprivation, burnout, career advice and philosophical perspectives.\n4. The strategies to rediscover your passion, find a new course and pursue what is required to find fulfillment.\nA primary responsibility of physicians is to add value and meaning to our patients lives and that of our own.\nTo fulfill only one of these criteria is not enough. Without value and meaning in our own lives it is almost impossible to provide it to that of our patients.\nAs physicians, we hold a most privileged position. We intersect with our patients lives, often in their darkest hour, with them asking for our help. For physicians to sustainably provide that help, they must first and foremost help themselves. Not to do so will ultimately degrade one of the most sacred of relationships: that of the patient in need and the doctor who can tend to that need.\nThe Doctor Paradox also serves to explore a ‘New Medicine’ where the traditional model of what it means to be a doctor has changed. That the doctor of the future will still be adding immense value and meaning to patients lives but may be doing so in ways not conventionally pursued before. The physicians of the future will help patients across a spectrum of care, from face to face clinical encounters to designing and developing novel technologies that will significantly impact the lives of patients. For a ‘New Medicine’ we need a ‘New Doctor’.\nThe future of medicine is bright but unless we begin a major course correction, physicians drift toward ever increasing uncertainty.\nAs the famous saying goes:\n“Things always get worse…. before they get worse”.\nIt is up to us as physicians to effect the changes we wish to see in our own lives and in doing so, ultimately that of our patients.\nThings are getting worse, let’s make them better.\nWe are ‘standing on the shoulders of giants’, so it’s not that we ought to, it’s that we have to.","DUBLAB, the Los Angeles-based music collective and radio station, presents a weekly podcast featuring the best live sets and interviews captured in our studio and at our events.

In\nfact, the Hindu Yugas advance the notion that Homo Sapiens are millions of years old, and have lived on\nplanet Earth through a series of rebirths.\nIt’s now a fact that we are the survivors of a series of cataclysmic events that took place approximately\n12,000 to 14,000 years ago. Our ancestors may have been aware of these impending disasters and fled\nunderground shelter, or survived in caves; others may have left the planet, but a huge number perished.\nThough Earth Ancients does explore some of the popular theories that ancient aliens have visited our\n\nplanet, our philosophy and research paradigm is decidedly Earth-centric, elevating the historical discourse\nabout human brilliance and ingenuity found in the archaeological evidence.

As I moved through the misty dawn, I focused on a faint, far away motion. I saw a youth, bending and reaching and flailing arms, dancing on the beach, no doubt in celebration of the perfect day soon to begin.\n  As I approached, I sadly realized that the youth was not dancing to the bay, but rather bending to sift through the debris left by the night's tide, stopping now and then to pick up a starfish and then standing, to heave it back into the sea. I asked the youth the purpose of the effort. \"The tide has washed the starfish onto the beach and they cannot return to the sea by themselves,\" the youth replied. \"When the sun rises, they will die, unless I throw them back to the sea.\"\n  As the youth explained, I surveyed the vast expanse of beach, stretching in both directions beyond my sight. Starfish littered the shore in numbers beyond calculation. The hopelessness of the youth's plan became clear to me and I countered, \"But there are more starfish on this beach than you can ever save before the sun is up. Surely you cannot expect to make a difference.\"\n  The youth paused briefly to consider my words, bent to pick up a starfish and threw it as far as possible. Turning to me he simply said, \"I made a difference to that one.\"\n  I left the boy and went home, deep in thought of what the boy had said. I returned to the beach and spent the rest of the day helping the boy throw starfish in to the sea.\n...based on the story by Loren Eisley\n\n\n\n\n_uacct = \"UA-2329378-1\";\nurchinTracker();","Your Story Hour encourages young people to develop a strong Christian character through its dramatized radio program (English, Spanish & Russian), free Bible lessons and online magazine for kids.

Beckett has written for Life on the Swingset. The website was born out of the feeling that he’d learned enough in his whole year of swinging to tell other people how to live their non-monogamous lives. His hubris can be seen from space. Here he has collected personal essays, stories, erotica, and prescriptive “how-tos” into this memoir of his life on The Swingset.\n\n\n\nHe may be biased when it comes to swinging, polyamory, and other forms of ethical non-monogamy (in fact, he most certainly is) but he doesn’t sugar-coat it. He speaks honestly and earnestly about a unique way to live life, one that allows for sexual and loving growth and experimentation, a strong sense of community, and the ability to do what we all crave whether we know it or not: Be honest with ourselves and others about what we want sexually. And out of life.","Join PotterCast in a continuing adventure through J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World.

Upon coming home from Vietnam in 1971, he had strange symptoms that until the early 1980’s, he thought were related to food allergies.  A research paper in 1980 entitled “Antigenically Intact Food Macromolecules Exiting The Gut Lumen” offered insight into the role of the terrain of the intestines in food allergies.  As long as the intestines leaked, which is not uncommon, food allergies tend to change as the diet changed.  After studying the reason that foods were able to leak through the intestines, Doug saw the role of fungus in provoking both symptoms and diseases.  As it turned out, whether it was yeast in alcoholic beverages,  mold by-products of medications like commonly taken antibiotics, or mere fungi like mushrooms,  a link to illness, unknown to physicians, became apparent.","Naked Genetics takes a look at the science of genes.

And, it’s a habit that is very simple to quit… you simply stop drinking.\n\nAlcohol Mastery focuses on the immense gains you get when you move away from alcohol,  rather than dwelling on the loss of the precious poison.  It’s about stepping away from the alcoholic label, perpetuating the AA type ‘alcoholic forever’ mentality, and blaming the alcohol instead of the drinker.\n\nAlcohol Mastery is about guiding you onwards, toward your new life of freedom, control, and self respect.\n\nSome of the topics covered include frequently asked questions about common problems you might encounter when you quit drinking, general quitting alcohol tips and advice, and regular updates about my stop drinking alcohol journey.\n\nThere are new episodes being posted all the time, so make sure you come back regularly.\n\nOnwards and upwards!","المصحف المرتل بصوت القارئ سعد الغامدي، والذي يمتاز بجودة صوتية عالية بتقنية Mp3 128 kb.\nويمكن تحميله بتقنية التورنت وذلك من خلال الضغط على صورة التورنت.","In Portland as it is in Heaven.

My co-host is Rick \"Oz\" Osmon. For the past 45 years we have been researching the connecting links between all things having to do with the secrets and pernicious deeds of a group of secret society outlaws who are working together behind the scenes to create a completely controlled world society with them as bosses and you and I as slaves to their system. This continuing scheme is popularly known as the New World Order, or the NWO.\n\nOur research actually began with the search for the origin of the so-called UFOs.  My starting point in the mid-60s was the fact that they are real, nuts and bolts craft controlled by advanced civilizations with bases here on earth. The fact that these advanced technological aircraft exists as solid metallic flying machines is based on my personal up-close observation of one.  My early research indicates that MOST of the unexplained airships we see in our skies are from somewhere ON or INSIDE our planet.  This led to my research of the Hollow Earth/ Subterranean Theories in the 1980s-90s which led to my realization that the answers I seek are in the control of a number of elitist groups and secret societies that I call collectively the Controllers.  And as even a quick look at recent worldwide events should convince anyone who is paying attention the Controllers plan is working very well, thank you.  Sometime around 14 years ago I was joined in my research by our co-host, the OZ.\n\nIt is these things and more that we will explore on this radio show.  Join us as we work towards . . .

Перевод: Александр Драгилев (Свами Б.Ч. Бхарати). Текст читает: Сергей Русскин (Сундар Дути дас). Муз. оформление: Алексей Лукьянов (Аджита Кришна дас).

As she guides people through the powerful process of inquiry she calls The Work, they find that their stressful beliefs—about life, other people, or themselves—radically shift and their lives are changed forever. Based on Byron Katie's direct experience of how suffering is created and ended, The Work is an astonishingly simple process, accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds, and requires nothing more than a pen, paper, and an open mind. Through this process, anyone can learn to trace unhappiness to its source and deal with it there. Katie (as everyone calls her) not only shows us that all the problems in the world originate in our thinking: she gives us the tool to open our minds and set ourselves free.","The simple sophisticate is someone who prefers quality over quantity, sensible living over mindless consumption, personal style instead of trendy fashions, has an insatiable curiosity for life’s endless questions and a desire to live a truly fulfilling life rather than being led around by the nose.

We explore thought-provoking concepts that address how to set yourself apart from the crowd and how to succeed on your own. Bio Kenny’s interest in the trucking industry began early. He was about 10 when his dad first let him drive a truck, and soon afterward he was eagerly helping to work on them as well. At 18, he started driving legally, working at his dad’s excavating company in Michigan. It was there that he cut his teeth pulling heavy haul doubles, end dump, and RGN. Kenny moved to Florida in 2006 and bought his own OTR tractor. He leased on to a few percentage-pay carriers before finding a home at Landstar. He had a terrific experience there, and would probably still be leased on to Landstar today if it weren’t for his military obligations: the US Army requested that he deploy to Kuwait and Iraq in 2011. Kenny proudly served alongside his brothers and sisters, operating flatbeds and heavy equipment trucks in areas where an improperly-secured load posed a risk much greater than just an OOS violation. When Kenny returned home in 2012, he decided to get his own authority, along with a plan of teaching his wife Elizabeth to drive his truck. Although she’d never even been inside a truck, Elizabeth was a quick study. They’ve been operating as a team ever since, and enjoy exploring and absorbing the sights of our beautiful nation together. Over the 17 years that he’s officially worked in the trucking industry, Kenny has always considered himself to be self-employed.

The recipient of the message is Arjuna, the prototype of the struggling human soul who is ready to receive the great knowledge by his close companionship and increasing nearness to the divine Self within himself.\nThis symbolic companionship of Krishna and Arjuna, the divine and the human soul is further dramatized by the fact that their dialogue takes place amidst the din and clamor of a battlefield. The teacher in the Gita is therefore not only the God who is transcendent but also the God in man who unveils Himself through an increasing knowledge...\n                                                                     Vanamali, Nitya Yoga.\nAldous Huxley, asserts that ‘The Bhagavad Gita occupies an intermediate position between scripture and theology; for it combines the poetical qualities of the first with the clear-cut methodicalness of the second. ‘The book may be described’ writes Ananda K. Coomaraswamy in his admirable Hinduism and Buddhism, ‘as a compendium of the whole doctrine to be found in the earlier Vedas, Brahmanas and Upanishads, and being therefore the basis of all the The later developments, it can be regarded as the focus of all Indian religion...\n...But this focus of Indian religion is also one of the clearest and most comprehensive summaries of the perennial philosophy ever to have been made. Hence its enduring value, not only for Indians, but for all mankind’.\nThe Bhagavad Gita (Song Celestial) offers an understanding of The Great Mystery, which has inspired many of the giants of the Western intellectual tradition. The transcendentalist poets Emerson, Thoreau, and Whitman were students of The Bhagavad Gita. Thoreau wrote: ‘In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous cosmological philosophy of The Bhagavad Gita, in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial.’\nEmerson, referring to the Gita, wrote: ‘It was the first of books. It was as if an empire spoke to us, nothing small or unworthy, but large, serene, consistent, the voice of an old intelligence which in another age . . . had pondered and thus disposed of the same questions which exercise us.’\nThis is a series of discourses on the liberating teachings of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita (Song Celestial) by Mataji (Mother) Vanamali, Vanamali Gita Yogasram, Rishikesh, North India.\nVanamali Mataji is the author of The Lila Hindu World Heritage Library. Her books include: a translation of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita, Nitya Yoga, a commentary on the Bhagavad Gita,  Sri Krishna Lila, Sri Rama Lila, Sri Shiva Lila, Sri Devi Lila, Sri Hanuman Lila, Lilas of the Sons of Shiva, Gurudeva  and The Taste Divine. Sri Devi Lila is published in the U.S. as  Shakti: Realm of The Divine Mother , Sri Hanuman Lila  as  Hanuman: The Devotion and Power of The Monkey God.\nEach talk is introduced with the Sanskrit invocations and chanting of the Gita chapter.

His whole life has been exemplified by his goal of seeking and conveying Islamic knowledge in order to “Change the Muslim Nation through Islamic Education.”\n\n\n\nIn preparation for this goal, he first acquired a B.A. from the College of Islamic Disciplines at the Islamic University of Medina (1979), then an M.A. in aqeedah (Islamic Theology) from King Saud University in Riyadh (1985), and finally a PhD in Islamic Theology from the University of Wales (1994). Interestingly enough, His PhD thesis was on \"The Exorcist Tradition in Islam\".\n\n\n\nAfter graduation from the University of Medina, Dr Bilal spent ten years teaching Islamic studies in an Islamic high school in Riyadh, and another ten years lecturing in Arabic and Islamic studies in the American University in Dubai, UAE.\n\n\n\nIn 1994 he founded the first Islamic Information Center in Dubai. He has served as the head of the Department of Arabic and Islamic Studies at Preston University-Ajman, UAE; lecturer and director of the Da'wah and Education at Qatar Guest Center, Doha, Qatar; founder and head of the English medium Islamic studies department of Knowledge International University, Riyadh; founder and head of the College of Da'wah and Islamic Culture (English Section) at Omdurman Islamic University, Sudan; founder and head of Preston International University College in Chennai, India; and founder and Dean of the Islamic Studies Academy in Doha, Qatar.\n\n\n\nBut perhaps his greatest achievement, and the one for which he was listed in the Jordanian publication, 'The 500 Most Influential Muslims', is the historic founding of the Islamic Online University which in only 5 years has over 80,000 students registered from every country on the face of this earth! Unlike the other educational programs he has founded and overseen over the years, IOU makes it possible for any person from any location in the world to receive an Islamic education absolutely free.","Extraterrestrial invasion, the earth taken over by omniscient intelligences from Mars, the whole of humanity under siege and a nameless narrator who seems to be the lone survivor of the complete devastation of human civilization – scenes from a Hollywood sci-fi blockbuster? Far from it! The War of the Worlds by HG Wells was written more than a century ago and went on to become an iconic work in the science fiction genre, spawning a whole new genre of literature featuring alien invaders. It was in fact the first book to present the idea of conflict between inhabitants of different planets.\n\nThe story begins in an observatory in Ottershaw, when scientists note a series of mysterious explosions taking place on Mars. Some days later, the narrator who is on a walk on the Surrey Downs notices a weird cylindrical vehicle that suddenly opens to release a horde of hideous creatures who are later discovered to be Martians. The creatures are unable to breathe Earth's air and swiftly return to their vehicle. A peace delegation of humans tries to make contact but they're ruthlessly scorched to death by Martian heat-ray weapons. Thus begins the War of the Worlds. The British military swings into action, but their arms and ammunition are defenseless against sophisticated chemical weapons and heat-rays.\n\nEvents race towards calamity as the nations of the earth unite to combat these fearful invaders to no avail. Survivors are reduced to scavenging for food with the cities of the world reduced to mere rubble. Can the human race survive? Will the narrator and his family escape destruction?\n\nThe author, HG Wells was a science teacher in a small village in Somerset, England. However, he was also a gifted writer who wrote in several genres – science fiction, literary novels, short stories, history, politics and social sciences. A keen student of war and combat, he created a set of rules for playing war games with toy soldiers, which provides an interesting glimpse of logistics, strategy and close combat techniques. Wells' contribution to our ideas of science fiction remains unparalleled and the book has been widely filmed, staged and televised. The War of the Worlds was immortalized as a Halloween prank in a radio show that aired on CBS on October 30, 1938, causing widespread panic and chaos as listeners across the United States tuned in and began fleeing from their homes!\n\nThe enduring appeal of this book makes it a must read classic for readers of all ages.","NBC's Press:Here is a weekly round table featuring top names in Silicon Valley in conversation with the world class technology reporters.","Please join co-hosts Danna Bowman and Tiffany Mladinich to lightheartedly, yet thoroughly discuss thyroid disease with some of the most advanced, innovative physicians, educators, bloggers, thyroid thrivers and advocates available.\n\nIn easy-going 'talk show' style, we set out on a mission to ensure that no one ever goes undiagnosed and/or undertreated and that all are aware of the intricacies that involve living life to the fullest with thyroid disease.\nUnited and informed, we will change the awareness, perception, diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disease.

Written in an easy and light style, the author attempts to bring the pantheon of gods into a comprehensible format. He organizes them into different dynasties and chronologies to make it easier for the reader to understand the labyrinthine relationships and connections between the various gods, heroes, minor divinities, mythical figures and legendary creatures.\n\nGreek and Roman legends form the base of all European art, literature and civilization itself. Since the advent of Christianity, the so called Pagan religion which dominated all of Europe for thousands of years were eclipsed but the study of the Classics as part of the education in Greek and Latin kept them alive. Today there's hardly a serious student of English or art who does not encounter some reference to an ancient Greek or Roman myth or deity somewhere in literature and the Western languages. A visit to any of the museums or classical art galleries in Europe would be one that's filled with allusions and depictions of Greek or Roman legends.\n\nFor modern day readers, the book is a mine of information about the lineage of the gods, forms of worship, festivals and temples devoted to them. It is interestingly chronicled, right from the primordial legend of Uranus and Gaia to the Creation of the Earth, through the dynasties of the Gods, heroes and divinities of the Night and the Sea, right up to the Trojan War where the Gods played a most important role in the destiny of humans. The section on temples and worship is especially interesting for students of archeology and history. It also includes statues, augurs, soothsayers, temple architecture, altars, priests and sacrifices.\n\nThe extensive footnotes and author's notes for each chapter add value and interest while the charming illustrations make it attractive for younger readers. Anyone who is interested in exploring the ancient legends of two of the oldest Western civilizations would certainly find Myths and Legends of Ancient Greece and Rome by E.M. Berens a source of hours of reading pleasure and a valuable addition to their bookshelf.","Providing ambitious business leaders the research and expertise needed to drive growth.","Talking about the BSD family of free operating systems.","The Telegraph Cycling Podcast is a podcast about all things cycling.

It describes an omniscient, all powerful God, the Fall of Man, the Temptation in the Garden of Eden, the disgraced angel who later becomes known as Satan, the Angelic Wars fought by Archangels Michael and Raphael and the Son of God who is the real hero of this saga.\n\nThe poet John Milton was more than sixty years old when he embarked on this immense work of literary creation. His father was a wealthy merchant who had embraced Protestantism despite opposition from his Catholic family. Milton grew up in a privileged environment, having been schooled at home by private tutors and traveling extensively throughout Italy. It was here that he first read Virgil and Homer and decided to create his own epic in English.\n\nTumultuous historical events intervened, like the English Civil War and the establishment of Puritan Rule. Milton was deeply embroiled in politics and the new parliament. When the monarchy was restored, Milton found himself on the wrong side and he retreated into hiding where he began working on his dream of creating an epic to match the best in Latin and Greek. He completed it after five years of tremendous effort, since he was already totally blind when he began working. The entire work, consisting of nearly ten thousand individual lines of blank verse was dictated by Milton from memory, to a series of scribes.\n\nParadise Lost consists of twelve smaller volumes divided into Books. Each one is devoted to a particular Biblical episode. It begins with a prologue that describes the subject of the epic, much like an introduction. The action shifts to the rebellion of Lucifer and from then on, to familiar episodes like the temptation of Adam and Eve and their disobedience to God's laws. Satan and his unholy legions are described in great detail as are their rebellion and malevolence. Adam and Eve, God and the Son of God are portrayed in brilliant, unforgettable lines and the conflict between the forces of good and evil is represented on a cosmic scale.\n\nFor lovers of poetry and literature, Paradise Lost represents a seminal work of supreme importance in English literature. Present-day readers will certainly find it fascinating to decode the multitude of classical references, Biblical lore, social and cultural themes that adorn this great work.","The Amy Schumer of Sports Talk","Building on the popular 1 Year Daily Audio Bible, the community expands to provide the Daily Audio Bible Arabic العربية.

Friday. Webb had starred in a few mostly short-lived radio programs, but Dragnet would make him one of the major media personalities of his era.Webb was a stickler for accurate details, and Dragnet used many authentic touches, such as the LAPD's actual radio call sign (KMA-367), and the names of many real department officials, such as Ray Pinker and Lee Jones of the crime lab or Chief of Detectives Thad Brown. Dragnet was perhaps the most famous and influential police procedural drama in American media history. The series gave millions of Americans a feel for the boredom and drudgery, as well as the danger and heroism, of real-life police work. Dragnet earned praise for improving the public opinion of police officers. Actor and producer Jack Webbâs aims in Dragnet were for realism and unpretentious acting. He achieved both goals, and Dragnet remains a key influence on subsequent police dramas in many media. The shows cultural impact is demonstrated by the fact that even after five decades, elements of Dragnet are known to those who've never seen or heard the program.","In March of 2009 Pharmacy Industry Innovator – Todd Eury founded the Pharmacy Podcast Show and dedicated the programs to his pharmacy industry contacts, prospects, and customers.\n\nThe Pharmacy Podcast Show is about good useable content, information, and innovative ideas that we believe will help privately owned pharmacy businesses.\n\nWe dedicated our programming to Independent Retail, Long-term Care, Specialty, Small Chain, – Pharmacy Businesses and have dedicated content for each of these specific pharmacy business models.

Each Upanishad explains these in its own unique way. Upanishads, thus, form the philosophical portion of the Vedas.  They are, in general, in the form of a dialogue between a teacher and a student.\n\n            One may begin the study of the Upanishads from the Mundaka Upanishad as it is in this Upanishad that the teachings are given in a systematic manner.\n\n            Accompanying text for Mundaka Upanishad is available for download.\n\n            The entire collection of Swamiji's talks is available at the Poornalayam website.","نبيل العوضي","Mousetalgia is a podcast for Disney fans about Disneyland, Disney in society, and Disney trivia and history.

Most people focus only on one or two things, that's why they fail. Most people focus on either 1) eating right or 2) exercising more.\n\nWhile those two things are the nuts and bolts to losing weight. There are two other elements that are just as important and without implementing them you are destined to fail. In order to successfully lose weight and keep it off you also must have 3) a support sytem and 4) an accountability system in place.\n\nWe discovered the importance of support and accountability during the time we owned a personal training studio. Our clients were able to stay compliant with their eating and exercise programs as long as a trainer was there to support them and keep them accountable. If a client ever left, they inevitably had a difficult time staying compliant and eventually gained the weight they had struggled so desperately to lose right back.\n\nIn order to make personal training (which is typically very expensive) more accessible to everyone we developed the Partner Power Weight Loss Program. Partner Power teaches you some of the pyschological dynamics that help trainers support their clients and keep them accountable.

I’m a normal person, not some big company and not some native Spanish speaker. I’m not a natural language learner at all actually. My first brush with Spanish ended with me getting an F in high school!  But somewhere along the way, I fell in love! I’m not sure if I love Spanish because I love traveling, or I love traveling because I love Spanish (and food). But I love them both.  Naturally, I want more people to love what I love, but I know that you probably don’t see Spanish like I do… not yet! That’s the point of this podcast.  I want to show you that there is ANOTHER WAY! That most of the strategies and tactics they used to teach us Spanish in high school are IGNORANT.  They are ignorant to our plight.   I know your mistakes. I understand why you make them. They were my mistakes too!  I remember the pain and the agony of having to figure it all out myself because... let’s just say... I was underwhelmed with the resources out there.

The radio show first aired on April 26, 1952 and ran until June 18, 1961 on the CBS radio network. The series starred William Conrad as Marshal Matt Dillon, Howard McNear as Doc Charles Adams, Georgia Ellis as Kitty Russell, and Parley Baer as Deputy Chester Proudfoot. Doc’s first name and Chester’s last name were changed for the television program. Gunsmoke was notable for its critically acclaimed cast and writing, and is commonly regarded as one of the finest old time radio shows. Some listeners have argued that the radio version of Gunsmoke was far more realistic than the television program. Episodes were aimed at adults, and featured some of the most explicit content of the day: there were violent crimes and scalpings, massacres and opium addicts. Miss Kitty’s occupation as a prostitute was made far more obvious on the radio version than on television. Many episodes ended on a down-note, and villains often got away with their crimes.","With healthy living and green alternatives becoming the norm, and flexibility and time-freedom becoming a priority, it’s no wonder that the home-based oil business industry has recently exploded!\n\nIn this 30 day audio bootcamp, we take you on a step-by-step journey of what it's really like to grow your own essential oil business as a Young Living Independent Distributor.","Ed Gandia, co-author of the bestselling book, The Wealthy Freelancer, reveals how to propel your writing business to the six-figure level (or the part-time equivalent).

We were having some dinner and talking about bikes, riding, and other aspects of chopperin'. My brothers wife leans over and says, \"You should do a blog or podcast; something about choppers and interview people or something.\"\nMy initial reaction was and I quote \"Lamest idea ever.\" There were/are many excuses why I didn't want to start one, but I couldn't really come up with a valid reason why I shouldn't. Then it hit me... I love motorcycles, mostly noisy, greasy, oil leaking, hand built, choppers, but none the less I love them. After attending my first Born Free, meeting various people, and having an all around great time I realized that I wanted to share this love of two wheels and the people behind the machines with the world.\nChopper Prophets was born almost literally over a 24 hour period, but for everything to come together, it's been quite a ride.

Not just the bikes, the builders, and the events, but the people. The people are what make this culture what it is and they are as unique as the bikes they build and/or ride.\nIt's not just about those who build or ride though. Chopperin' is a mental state that says \"I know how it's supposed to be, but I'm going to do it this way.\" There are very few differences between a hacker and someone who has this mind set. They both end with something being taken apart and modified. I think that's what I love most of all about the culture.\nSo, here we are now.

Set at the turn of the 19th century, Pride and Prejudice catches a perfect glimpse not only of a time when women were socially and economically dependent solely on their marital status, but also as an age of enlightenment and witness of the French Revolution.\n\nThis romantic novel with its hint of comic references begins with the famous quote \"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\"\nThis famous quotation sets the story into motion as the eligible Mr. Bingley is introduced as he rides into town. The quote also draws in and to some extent reveals the content of the plot to come. Soon the news of the arrival of the well off Charles Bingley finds its way to the ears of the Bennett household. Having five unmarried daughters, the Bennetts are eager to match them up with suitable spouse candidates and see them prosperously married. After attending a ball, Mr. Bingley is instantly attracted to the oldest Bennett daughter Jane and it is fair to say that the feeling is mutual. Such cannot be said about his close friend Mr. Darcy who rudely refuses to dance with the second Bennett daughter Elizabeth. Consequently, Elizabeth’s first prejudice is born as she labels Mr. Darcy arrogant and obnoxious; however, she later learns never to judge a book by its cover and must swallow up her pride to achieve happiness. Pride and Prejudice witnesses the exciting courtships of the Bennett sisters and their suitors, as well as the not so joyful relationships of other characters. As the novel develops the relationships between the characters must outweigh the forces seeking to tear them apart.\n\nExperience the adventures of the Bennett sisters as they face the troublesome issues of manners, social class, family, and marriages in a male reliant society. A story not only portraying the unreliable nature of pride and prejudice, Austen’s classic also paints a vivid image of the past and the woman as a member of society.","Features stories about U.S. Navy Sailors and U.S. Marines serving around the globe.

While Stephanie had been watching LOST from the very first episode, Cliff had got hooked on the show after catching the last four episodes of the first season. For Cliff, it was the hidden clues and the overall mystery of the island that drew him in.\nCliff had initially started out blogging about Lost and listening to a small handful of Lost Podcasts. Many of Cliff’s blog posts highlighting easter eggs and unique theories were picked up by major media outlets like Entertainment Weekly. When Cliff was encouraged by Lost Podcasters, Ryan & Jenn Ozawa, to launch his own podcast, he jumped at the opportunity and convinced Stephanie to join him.\nThe rest is history which you can read on the GSPN Wikipedia page. While the show was on the air, Cliff and Stephanie produced two podcast episodes every week devoted to the show. They would record an initial reaction podcast immediately following the episode and then they would produce a full weekend review in a live audience setting on the gspn.tv live show page.\nNow that the series has come to an end, the show is no longer produced on a “weekly” basis. However, more episodes of this podcast will be produced as they feel prompted to do so and as they have the opportunity to interview more members of the cast and crew from the show.","Parenting is not a clean-cut, simple process for those who like to follow the rules.

It is called Shabbos, or Shabbat, the day of rest. On this day we emulate that which the Creator did when He was involved in His creation. He spent six days in creative mode, and the seventh was a time for reflection on all He had done. This corresponds to the Kabbalistic concept of the male (which is represented by the number six), and the female (which is the number seven). The Jewish people are called the bride of God, and therefore, the special laws of Shabbos constitute a special covenant between God and Israel. This podcast seeks to study these laws, in all their intricate details, so we can fully develop our connection and relationship with God on this special day.","(Formerly known as StarStuff).

This is what forms the time line of one man's quest for the simple life and a unique social experiment in complete self reliance and independence. Henry David Thoreau published Walden in 1884. Originally drafted as a series of essays describing a most significant episode in his life, it was finally released in book form with each essay taking on the form of a separate chapter.\n\nThoreau's parents were in financial straights, but rich intellectually and culturally. The young Henry was educated in the best of schools in their home town, Concord, Massachusetts and went on to graduate from Harvard, where he read history, philosophy, theology and literature. He commenced working as a school master in Concord but soon quit when he discovered that he was not ideologically suited to methods employed in those days which included corporal punishment. During this time, a chance meeting with the great philosopher, Ralph Waldo Emerson marked a turning point in his life.\n\nDeeply influenced by Emerson's ideas and his Transcendentalism cult, Thoreau embarked on the Walden experiment. The Transcendentalism movement was an amalgam of Buddhism, German and English Romanticism, Hindu teachings, Confucianism and placed great emphasis on emotional wellbeing, self reliance and personal truths rather than social norms. It rejected society's dominance over the individual.\n\nWalden Pond was located in a property owned by Emerson. Here, Thoreau built a cabin and proceeded to live a completely self sufficient life, gathering his own food and preparing it, sleeping and reading and appreciating nature as the whim took him. He meticulously recorded every experience and this forms the body of work known as Walden.\n\nThe book received a lukewarm reception when it first appeared, but went on to gather cult status with the advent of the Flower Power generation, the anti-establishment movements against the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights movement. The concepts of individual freedom and individual choice became ingrained in the American psyche as a new generation of Americans re-discovered Walden.\n\nWalden's main appeal lies in its exploration of themes like solitude, economy, the simple life and the Higher Laws that he describes which relate to man's relationship to nature. Thoreau's style is attractive and easy, full of nuggets of folksy wisdom. Modern proponents of simplifying life, those who oppose our over reliance on technology and advocates of inner spiritual awakening are sure to find Walden a valuable and rewarding read.","A podcast by Cognitect, Inc. about software and the people that create it.

The story centers on Finn Caspian, an 8-year-old boy aboard The Famous Marlowe 280 Interplanetary Exploratory Space Station. He and his friends Abigail, Elias and Vale are Explorers Troop 301, taking off from the Marlowe to explore uncharted planets, help the occasional alien, and solve a mystery that threatens to destroy the Marlowe.

His son Griffin, 7, serves as editor of the story, appearing in episodes to critique, make predictions and express skepticism that his father knows what he's talking about, which also happens to be the way the rest of their relationship works.","팝 음악, 영화 등 친숙한 소재를 통해 즐거운 영어학습을 유도하는 에듀테인먼트 프로그램.","Yahweh's Restoration Ministry, in seeking to adhere to all the Word as found in the holy Scriptures, is dedicated to being faithfully diligent in presenting this knowledge to all those who earnestly search for the truth of the Bible.  “And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in” (Isa. 58:12).","Join Leo Laporte, Scott Bourne, and Alex Lindsay each week as they navigate through the tools and techniques of producing media for the internet.

The human race fights back, yet after every battle the disease responds, adapts, using sophisticated strategies and brilliant ruses to fool its pursuers. The only possible explanation: the epidemic is driven not by evolution but by some malevolent intelligence.\n\nStanding against this unimaginable threat is a small group, assembled under the strictest secrecy. Their best weapon is hulking former football star Perry Dawsey, left psychologically shattered by his own struggles with this terrible enemy, who possesses an unexplainable ability to locate the disease’s hosts. Violent and unpredictable, Perry is both the nation’s best hope and a terrifying liability. Hardened CIA veteran Dew Phillips must somehow forge a connection with him if they’re going to stand a chance against this maddeningly adaptable opponent. Alongside them is Margaret Montoya, a brilliant epidemiologist who fights for a cure even as she reels under the weight of endless horrors.\n\nThese three and their team have kept humanity in the game, but that’s not good enough anymore, not when the disease turns contagious, triggering a fast countdown to Armageddon. Meanwhile, other enemies join the battle, and a new threat — one that comes from a most unexpected source — may ultimately prove the most dangerous of all.\n\nCatapulting the reader into a world where humanity’s life span is measured in hours and the president’s finger hovers over the nuclear button, rising star Scott Sigler takes us on a breathtaking, hyper-adrenalized ride filled with terror and jaw-dropping action.

This is an approach to recovery that understands; “All individuals have the power and potential to free themselves from the suffering that is caused by addiction”. We feel confident in the power of the Dharma, if applied, to relieve suffering of all kinds, including the suffering of addiction. This is a process that cultivates a path of awakening, the path of recovering from the addictions and delusions that have created so much suffering in our lives and in this world.\n\nRefuge Recovery is a systematic approach to training our hearts and minds to see clearly and respond to our lives with understanding and non-harming. You are entering a way of life that may be familiar to some and foreign to others. In the beginning some of it may seem confusing or counter-instinctual, and some of it is. But you will find that with time, familiarity and experience, it will all make perfect sense and will gradually become a more and more natural way of being.\nwww.refugerecovery.org\n\nHello Refuge Recovery friends.

The list of career options available to medical students is large, but the time to explore them all is short.  Moreover, mentorship in medical school is lacking, and many medical students tackle the task of career planning alone, most struggling and almost all clutching to the hope that 3rd year clinical rotations will definitively resolve their remaining uncertainties about how they want to specialize. However, having been distracted by the relentless pace of their pre-clinical curricula and specter of Step 1, 3rd year medical students are eventually confronted with the reality that there are simply too many specialties to explore in one year and that they may not even get to finish their clinical rotations before important decisions about their careers need to be made (e.g., the planning of acting internships) if they are to be competitive applicants.  Thus, mentorless and clinically unexposed, many medical students are forced to make wholly uninformed decisions about their futures.  By interviewing at least one physician from each of the 120+ specialties listed on the AAMC's Careers in Medicine website 1) about their specialty, 2) how they decided this specialty was right for them, and 3) for advice about long-term career planning irrespective of the specialty they went into, this podcast aims to enumerate the details of every specialty and provide virtual mentorship on how best to go about moving past being an undifferentiated medical student.","We take a fresh look at board games as veteran publishers Ignacy Trzewiczek and Stephen Buonocore discuss the industry from the inside out.\n\n\n\nIntro Music: Happy Rock – Bensound.com","A bi-monthly podcast by geek girls who like to geek out and craft.","Dedicated to the slaves of the retail world and the s#*t we all put up with on a daily basis","Inspirational, intimate and disarmingly-unfiltered conversations about living a fully-engaged, fiercely-connected and meaning-drenched life.

Like all nomads they have few personal possessions and only live at one location for a short period of time.

This is when everyone comes together and shares food. Like traditional family meals this is when the day is discussed, stories are shared, and food is enjoyed.\n\nFood is culture.

Pychyl, associate professor of psychology and director of the Procrastination Research Group (Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada), provides a series of short talks, interviews and question/answer podcasts that explain why we procrastinate and what we can do about it.  An award winning educator, Dr. Pychyl challenges his listeners to explore their daily choices to act or postpone acting on their intentions. Do we head to the gym as intended, or slouch back on the couch thinking \"I'll feel more like a workout tomorrow\"? Do we tackle the task now, or do we avoid it arguing to ourselves that \"I work better under pressure\"? From losing 10 pounds to changing personal habits, Pychyl, a personality psychologist, focuses on the breakdown of intentional action - a problem commonly called procrastination. This series expands on three main themes: 1) irrational delay that sabotages personal productivity, 2) personality attributes that contribute to self-defeating behaviours, and 3) situational factors that undermine our ability to take or sustain action.  Drawing on the research literature, topics include: self-handicapping, anxiety, self-regulation, perfectionism, will power, coping styles, effects on health and well-being, impulsivity, temporal discounting, motivation and even purpose in life. Of course, Dr. Pychyl doesnâ€™t leave his listeners with the problem itself. Once these key factors have been established, he turns his attention to techniques that facilitate self change, habit-breaking implementation intentions, as well as strategies that help each of us to â€œcarpe diem!â€?  The emphasis is on self-understanding, practical advice and tools for change. We guarantee that you will find this an engaging series of podcasts that will provide you with tactics to increase personal productivity and well-being.","Relatively Prime features stories and interviews from the mathematical world.

If you’re looking to build an enormous business to support your own ego, this probably isn’t the best investment of your time. If you value currency over legacy, or are seeking a “passive” or “lifestyle” business…again, this is probably not for you. I’ve been there, done that, and I can promise you the reality is not what you’ve built it up in your head to be. I have this saying that an entrepreneur is someone who goes from working in their business, to on their business. However, there’s a second tier of entrepreneur who goes from working on their business, to working on themselves. THAT is who this is for. Those who know that good is the enemy of great, and are never satisfied with “good” in any area of their life - whether it be their health, business, or relationships. This is for those who are willing to sacrifice the person that they are for the one they want to become. That is who I am dedicating my life to serving. If what I have said here resonates with you, stay with me. I am a firm believer that the wisest investment is wisdom, and my commitment to you is to condense decades of insights and knowledge into days. My philosophy is that if I am transparent about my story, you can leverage my wins while at the same time avoiding my losses.","UNDRESSED explores what it means to live your life with style.

During the editorial process, significant changes and improvements were made to Descent's print manuscript. Character names were changed, and events at the end of the print novel were modified in ways that will impact the rest of the print trilogy. The print novel represents an official reboot of the 7th Son series.\n\nDue to these changes, this \"Beta Version\" of Book Two: Deceit is no longer the \"official\" version of the podiobook. Please visit the 7th Son: Descent (The Print Edition) page to subscribe to the definitive beginning of the trilogy. You're welcome to continue the series with this version of Deceit, but understand that you will encounter slight inconsistencies in character names and plot references.\n\nTHE STORY\nTwo days ago, seven human clones -- John, Michael, Father Thomas, Dr. Mike, Jonathan, Jack and Kilroy2.0 -- were torn away from their \"normal\" lives to stop a ruthless plot created by their progenitor, a man code-named John Alpha. Their quest was a descent into conspiracy, violence and death.\n\nThe clones were successful in their mission, but victory was not without its price.\n\nAs 7th Son: Book Two - Deceit begins, the Beta clones are demoralized, reeling from their loss ... and about to learn that John Alpha's plans are far from over.\n\nTo prevent the next phase of Alpha's plan, John, Kilroy2.0, and the others must unearth more dark secrets about the government project from which they were spawned. They will experience the horrors of betrayal, and race cross-country to track John Alpha.\n\nAnd they will finally realize the scope of Alpha's wrath -- the bloodshed the clones have witnessed is merely a prelude to the world-rending destruction to come. Unless they can stop it first.\n\nDeceit is the second novel in J.C. Hutchins' 7th Son thriller trilogy.","Ancient Worlds is the audio series of the Ancient Art Podcast where we choose a single work of art as a launchpad for inspiration.

Hephaestus Research Station, currently on Day 448 of its orbit around red dwarf star Wolf 359. He's stuck on a scientific survey mission of indeterminate length, 7.8 light years from Earth. His only company on board the station are stern mission chief Minkowski, insane science officer Hilbert, and Hephaestus Station's sentient, often malfunctioning operating system Hera. He doesn't have much to do for his job other than monitoring static and intercepting the occasional decades-old radio broadcast from Earth, so he spends most of his time creating extensive audio logs about the ordinary, day-to-day happenings within the station. But the Hephaestus is an odd place, and life in extremely isolated, zero gravity conditions has a way of doing funny things to people's minds. Even the simplest of tasks can turn into a gargantuan struggle, and the most ordinary-seeming things have a way of turning into anything but that.

Take one part space-faring adventure, add one part character drama, and mix in one part absurdist sitcom, and you get Wolf 359.

This podcast is for people who are interested in downsizing their life, creating remote income, and working from anywhere.\nThe RV Entrepreneur Podcast is a weekly show where I interview nomadic entrepreneurs who have made the leap into the RV lifestyle and have taken their businesses with them on the road. My name is Heath Padgett and in 2014 I quit my job in software sales to go on a year long RV trip across America with my newlywed wife. After spending a year on the road and traveling to all 50 states, we realized that returning back to “life as normal” in a 9-5 job wasn’t going to fly.

He was once kicked out of an ultra runing group due to allegations of cyber-bullying.  He has a habit of offending people by accident while trying to help them.  He is a co-founder of the Flatlander Ultrarunners in Chicagoland which has rapidly grown to over 600 members.

Sometimes he talks wayyyyy too much on the show but we overlook that, because it is a little known fact that he once stopped a coyote from attacking the gang with a cold dad stare.\nAmy Briggs was born with a piano attached to her fingers.  Given no choice, she took up the Tuba.  Not really.  She teaches piano at one of the top 5 Universities in the country and has played with with the Chicago Symphony, one of the best in the world.  When she is not focused on being at the top of her rather unusual field she hits the trails and Chicago Lakefront Path, training her ass off for her first 100 miler at Kettle Morraine in 2016 to accentuate her already stellar performances at the Marathon, 50K and 50 Mile distance.\nAaron German is a speedster, plain and simple.  He's the only one in the group that has ever cracked the three hour marathon barrier and the only one brave enough to wear mandex in public. He's a Kansas City native and University of Chicago grad that found out by accident that losing tons of weight can make you run faster.  Aaron trades stocks and fantasy baseball players while juggling the lack of commitments that comes with having no wife, no kids and no real job.  In short, Aaron has nothing better to do than run long and fast and think about funny things to say.\nMore at http://www.tenjunkmiles.com","Join Steve Kaufmann, founder of LingQ, and Tamaki, Hiro and others on the JapaneseLingQ podcast.

Текст читает: Сергей Русскин (Сундар Дути дас). Муз. оформление: Алексей Лукьянов (Аджита Кришна дас). В Ведах определены четыре цели человеческой жизни — здоровье, материальное благополучие, честное имя и свобода — и изложены способы их достижения. Но, записав Веды, античный мудрец Вьяса пришел к выводу, что ничто из вышеперечисленного не делает человека счастливым. И тогда по наставлению своего учителя Нарады, он написал Шримад Бхагаватам, где призвал людей отказаться от всего, к чему призывают Веды. Книга Вьясы представляет собой беседу между Императором древнего мира Парикшитом и блаженным странником Шукадевой.

Very loyal to the electronic culture club since then, Ferro has become a key name of the Portuguese underground music scene.\n\nBorn in Lisbon in 24th April 1973, he spent his early days in the well-known region of Algarve, southern Portugal. When he turned 18 years old he moved back to Lisbon on his own, not only because the attraction of the big city life but mainly because of his strong desire of getting to know artists and people involved in the dance scene. He was eager to make a breakthrough as well as establishing his style and own sound to a bulky audience.\n\nIt was only a matter of time, for those who remember, before his name started circulating around the elite and was being offered to playing in such places like: Locomia, Rocks, ZONA+, Coconuts, Plateau, Alcantara-Mar amongst others.\n\nWhen still working in the record shop Bimotor in charge of the imports, he formed a collective with A.paul and Wogz, two successful Techno Dj’s in Portugal, which would lead to the creation of a specific Portuguese techno label - Squeeze Records. Squeeze 001 ( A.paul & Ferro) appeared to be the so much wanted breakthrough, a smash! The right music was released at the right time and obviously the interest of the public kept growing. The next step was a very much awaited and acclaimed Compilation.\n\nOutside Portugal boundaries the success was discreet but flourishing. The German distributor Neuton shipped Squeeze around Europe and DJs like Sven Vath, Chris Liebing and Hardfloor charted it. At a certain point, during the ’boom’ of dance music in Portugal, X-Club acknowledged his work with a invitation to be one of the X artists, were he finally was able to set up his career. Places like Colombia and Slováquia, playing with DJs like Carl Cox, Jeff Mills, Dave Clarke, Richie Hawtin, The Advent, Mike Dearborn, DJ Rush, Derrick Carter, Dave Angel, Darren Price, Stacey Pullen, DJ Sneak, Green Velvet, Josh Wink, Damon Wild, Steve Stoll, Adam Beyer, Ben Long and many others, are common to him.\n\nToday Ricardo Ferro is the Label Manager of FAROL, the label of Media Capital and also the exclusive distributor of Warner Music in Portugal. His love for production is still alive, and he regularly delivers his new material. He also keeps his agenda full with gigs in Portugal and abroad.\n\nIn less than a decade, Ricardo Ferro managed to impose his fresh sound and smooth style with a clever blend of Techno, Techouse, Hardhouse, Progressive House, House and even Electro, his recent collaboration with Mourah under the project Echosonic is an example of it.\n\nYear after year he proves to his faithful audience to be an innovative, versatile and open-minded artist.

It’s an unfortunate truth, but “The Guru Party,” made up of the trainers, brokers & endless supply of coaches—and what they teach—are the architects responsible for bankrupting the real estate industry of trust. Because of them. The term “real estate agent,” in the eyes of society, has become a stain on your reputation. This podcast is the solution. As you know, I’ve been blessed. I’ve had so many wonderful things happen to me. And I’ve made wonderful things happen by virtue of the opportunities available to me, and by “seeing” the clearing through the fog. The Guru Party’s message, though, is that you must hunt and beg and demean yourself in a variety of “standard” ways to be successful in real estate. Like, “Prospecting is your job.” I reject that. The spirit of the Entrepreneur knows no limits. It would be shameful to waste it on prospecting. An activity of such low-status. To rise to new heights, though, you must understand the truths that enable you to defy “the gravity” that others tell you cannot be escaped. They are wrong. Their ‘lack of skills’ and ‘limited ambition’ blinds them to what is possible. This podcast, undoubtedly, will infuriate The Guru Party. They will reject it. That’s Ok. By the majority of low-information agents too, it will be rejected. Again, that's OK… because in time, after enough pain is experienced and suffered, enough struggle is endured, enough frustration is dealt with—they will come around. They will smarten up. They will wise up. They will realize The Guru's Party's approach has failed them for fundamental reasons. And they will stop trying to deny or outflank the reality of the truths presented on this podcast. They are, after all, undeniable…truths.

In the monthly podcasts, editors of the journal discuss highlights of the current issue, with occasional interviews with an author of a key article.","Welcome to the 1 Day Business Breakthrough (1DayBB) Podcast! Each episode features the voice of one real-life business owner who shares their most painful struggle, followed by a 15-minute \"hotseat\" where entrepreneur hosts Pat Flynn and Chris Ducker go back-and-forth to brainstorm, share ideas and develop strategics, tactics and tips to help that person break through their struggle. Each episode ends with both Pat and Chris sharing what each of their next steps would be.\n\n1DayBB started as a small, in-person event in San Diego where Pat and Chris would bring in 20 entrepreneurs and have them spend 15 minutes in the \"hotseat\"  to present their biggest struggle while the entire room would collaborate and mastermind to help that person find their breakthrough. All of this in one day. Hence, 1-Day Business Breakthrough.\n\nThe first 1DayBB event was held in 2013 and it was a massive success! Since then, Pat and Chris have held many more 1DayBB events, including one in Australia. Tickets for every event have sold out within 24 hours.\n\nDespite being massively popular, the small mastermind events are also extremely limited. The high demand for more gave Pat and Chris the idea for the 1DayBB podcast, adopting the same hotseat format to provide the most value to those featured on the show, and to those listening as well.\n\nIt doesn't matter what kind of business you have, what your target market is or what level you're at. The 1DayBB format provides the most value for your time possible. At the live events, all of the attendees agree: although their time in the hotseat was fantastic, it was their ability to listen to other people's hotseats that was the most helpful and inspiring.\n\nOf course, we haven't forgotten about the community aspect of the 1DayBB format either. If you go to 1DayBB.com/community, you can join in on the mastermind conversation about each episode as they come out.\n\nAnd finally, we couldn't hold back from continuing our live events, although we're opening it up to attendees in a much bigger way, and you won't even have to fly in to attend. For more information about our upcoming live event, visit 1DayBB.com/live.","Riding into the wild west of gunfighters, tales of cattle drives, and Sheriffs.Tales of rough and rowdy adventures of those hero's of the wild west","Hablando de Tecnología es el podcast oficial de Orlando Mergal.

Sixty-two stories that feature familiar figures like Hansel and Gretel, Rapunzel, Rumplestiltskin, The Twelve Dancing Princesses and Snow-White and Rose Red as well as lesser-known characters like The White Snake, Sweetheart Roland and Clever Elsie are contained in this volume of Grimms' Fairy Tales by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm.\n\nThe original volume published in 1812 contained more than 85 tales and this number kept increasing till it got to the seventh edition which contained more than two hundred stories. Initially the authors meant the collection to be read not just by children, but also adults and was meant to be a compilation of folk-tales that had been passed down orally for generations. The first edition was packed with scholarly foot-notes and interesting information about the cultural connotations of each story. Later, the authors were persuaded to change the format and make it suitable for children.\n\nHowever, many of these stories were found by publishers to be far too gruesome for young readers. Objectionable passages and scenes of violence were removed and replaced with less fearsome ones. The scholarly foot notes were completely eliminated, making the book just a collection of fairy tales that a child might enjoy. The present collection contains some of the most famous and well loved fairy tales that generations of children have enjoyed. The universal themes of fairy tales which include the triumph of good over evil, courage, common-sense, humility, love, the downfall of pride, greed, envy and laziness all find voice in the characters of Grimms' Fairy Tales.\n\nJacob and Wilhelm Grimm were two brothers born in Frankfurt in the old German kingdom of Hesse. They studied law, but were passionately interested in folklore. Jacob was also a philologist studying language. Though Wilhelm's ill-health made traveling difficult, they toured Germany and neighboring European countries in the 18th century documenting folk tales commonly recounted by word of mouth in small villages and communities. Their interest in preserving these historical examples of native wisdom and culture has made it possible for modern readers to enjoy these age old stories that were told and retold by countless grandparents to generations of grandchildren. Most of the stories retain the lyrical qualities of oral tradition and are meant to be read aloud, creating a magical world for children.\n\nThis treasure trove of stories has become an essential part of the bed-time ritual of story-telling for both parents and children all over the world.","THE 5-Star Ohio State Buckeyes Podcast\n\nJoin Jared & Kyle as they talk Ohio State Buckeyes, as well as National College Football, Basketball, and so much more.
